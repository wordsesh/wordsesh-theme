WordSesh Theme
==============
A theme that makes WordSesh possible.

[WordSesh.org](http://wordsesh.org/) automatically pulls from the master branch of this repository.

Welcome to the official WordSesh theme repository! You might think I'm *"just"* a theme but I'm actually more than just that. I'm an open source platform, built by the the [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) community to power the entire WordSesh event. 

If you'd like to help out, make sure to check out the contributing guidelines [here](https://github.com/wordsesh/wordsesh-theme/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!

Oh yea, and you can ~~use~~ fork me to power any event that you'd like!
